Kamil Szmyd README

Objective To create a website that encourages constructive debate by having users post arguments in pieces that can be individually commented on and discussed. When someone starts a discussion, they state their thoughts in separate bubbles within that post. Each bubble can be individually commented on and discussed. This will allow people to fully explore each aspect of each otherâ€™s arguments without losing the idea of the debate and facilitates learning through discussion. Users will sign up for the application by creating their own profile and then log in to interact with other members and various debates.
