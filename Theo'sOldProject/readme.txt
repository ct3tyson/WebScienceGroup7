Bktlstr
Team 2

Overview: 
Our web application is Bktlstr, a bucket list inspired idea that will allow users to update and track their lists in a social enviornment. Our vision for this project changed a few instances along the way but the overall idea stayed the same. 

Summary:
After all of the late nights of work, as a whole we are proud of what we've made Bktlstr to be. A majority of our ideas that we wanted to implement are functional in our final design as you will be able to see. A user can successfully sign-up and login, thus creating their own profile in our database, giving them the ability to access as well as edit their own personal profile page and bucket list. Each users bucket list begins as a private bucket list with items that cannot be seen by other users through the browse feature unless given authority by the "make public" feature. The users information is continuously stored in our database and will be saved after logout.
